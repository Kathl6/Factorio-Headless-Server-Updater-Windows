# Factorio Headless Server Updater for Windows

This is a simple app that updates a Factorio Headless server to the latest version installed on your computer.

## How it works

1. The Factorio game directory, original server directory, and the output directory must first be selected.
<br>
2. The game files are cloned from /bin and /data to the output folder.
<br>
3. The server save and files are cloned to the output folder; the configuration paths and start.bat file are updated.

The process is simple, though this app helps by making it automatic, convenient, and intuitive.

This was made as a small personal project for myself because I wanted to make my Factorio headless server updates quickly.
